# easyParser

What I did here is completely nuts.

I tried to see if I can emulate tail and head commands from linux only with awk, but this approach is not recommended. It is much better to have the main script written in bash and the awk to be called only when needed.

The validation part of the arguments given to the script is more difficult in AWK than in bash.

More validations must also be made regarding to the existence of the files analyzed with this script but this will be made when i will write the script like i told you above.
